## Why is there a fee for our consultation call? {#payments-faq-initial-fee}

When you [schedule our first meeting](https://calendly.com/attalitech/meeting) you'll notice that it requires a payment to be made upfront. 

Before adding this fee, several bookings were being made every single day. Many people either used the time as a free Q&A session or simply did not show up. The fee acts as a simple filter to ensure only serious requests are made.

If you would like the fee to be waived for administrative/bureaucratic reasons, please [email us](mailto:info@attalitech.com).
